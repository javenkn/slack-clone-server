## Purpose

To recreate a barebones Slack application while learning how to use React hooks, Node.js, Docker, Apollo, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL/Sequelize. Followed [benawad](https://www.youtube.com/user/99baddawg)'s tutorials to gain a better understanding of the different technologies used throughout this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
